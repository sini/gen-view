# Standalone (non-flake) entry. Flake consumers should use the `.lib` output.
#
# THREE CHANNELS, ONE PRECEDENCE, AND NONE OF THEM IS A PROBE. A named formal per dependency wins;
# the `inputs` bag is next, tested by attrset membership so a supplied-but-throwing value throws as
# ITSELF rather than falling back; the default is resolved from `./ci/flake.lock`, read as local
# data. There is NO `...`: an argument this root does not declare is a loud error, not a silent drop.
#
# THE PIN SOURCE IS THE ROOT `flake.lock`, NOT `ci/flake.lock` (ADR-0037 as amended 2026-09-15): a
# library's dependency graph and its test/oracle graph are SEPARATE, and the second must not enter
# the first — "whatever the optimal pattern is, it can no longer be DEFER TO THE TEST LOCK". The
# ci lock keeps every input it has, including any cycle it carries, and is the TEST graph's own
# pin source; no library code reads it any more. Both dependencies are root inputs of the root
# lock, so both paths below are one segment.
#
# `src` AND `dep` ARE FORMALS, NOT `let` BINDINGS, AND THAT IS THE INJECTABLE RESOLVER SEAM — the
# one channel a cell can close. `src` is the only expression here that fetches; everything else
# reads the lock as data. A caller supplying `src = segs: throw "…"` therefore makes fetching
# IMPOSSIBLE for that application rather than merely absent, which is what `ci/tests/entry.nix`
# rests on. A `dep` bound in the `let` below would close over the `let`'s `src`, so the override
# would silently do nothing and the shim would fetch anyway, at rc 0.
#
# The `let` is OUTSIDE the lambda because a formal's default is evaluated in the FORMAL scope, which
# does not see a `let` in the body.
let
  lock = builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./flake.lock);
  # A direct edge IS the node key; a `follows` value is a PATH resolved segment by segment from this
  # lock's own root. Never by indexing `lock.nodes.<label>` — a last-segment shortcut reads a
  # different node. gen-prelude's node key happens to equal its label at THIS library's own ci lock
  # (`gen-prelude` → `gen-prelude`, unlike gen-aspects and gen-memo), so a shortcut planted here would
  # read correctly against this one lock and hide behind it — the fixture in `ci/tests/entry.nix` is
  # built to disagree where this repository's own data cannot discriminate. IT TAKES ITS LOCK AS AN
  # ARGUMENT SO THAT THE ENTRY CELL CAN DRIVE THIS EXACT BINDING ON THAT FIXTURE; a resolver closed
  # over this library's own lock could only ever be compared against a second copy of itself. This is
  # the ONE declaration of the rule in this library — `ci/tests/entry.nix` reads this binding through
  # the record the body hands `wire`, instead of transcribing the fold a second time.

  # RECEIVES `{ deps, resolve }`, and passes on whatever it chooses to — here `deps` and nothing
  # else, but only because the default below reads `{ deps, resolve }: import ./lib deps,`. A cell
  # injecting `dep = segs: segs` alongside `wire = args: args` reads this shim's own formal-to-path
  # map AND its own resolver directly, with nothing fetched, no path restated and no fold
  # transcribed. The record destructures with no `...`, so a drifted body shape is loud at the
  # default; adding `wire` was a widening and breaks no caller for the same reason — there is no
  # `...` here, and no caller passes a name this root does not declare.

# THE BODY IS EAGER, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE ENTRY CELL TOTAL RATHER THAN PARTIAL. `forced` forces
# every wired dependency to WHNF before `./lib` sees it, so a default that cannot resolve is loud AT
# THE BOUNDARY rather than wherever a consumer first reaches an attribute. Without it a force of this
# root reaches none of its dependency paths: the body's own return value is already an attrset shell
# in WHNF (`import ./lib deps` resolves to `lib/default.nix`'s outer `{ ... }`), so `builtins.seq` of
# it never enters the lambda that binds `prelude`/`graph`, and `builtins.deepSeq` on the flake's
# exported surface cannot make up the difference either — it does not enter a lambda, and the
# standalone path is not wrapped in it at all. With the eager body a WHNF force of the root reaches
# both, whatever the published surface's shape.
#
# THE FORCE STOPS AT WHNF DELIBERATELY: `builtins.seq` of an attrset does not force its members, so
# this reaches each dependency's root VALUE and never a member of it. A library that deliberately
# refuses to build some member is therefore not an exception to it.
