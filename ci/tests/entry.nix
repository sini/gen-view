# THE STANDALONE ENTRY'S OWN DEFAULTS — the cells no other cell in this repository can be.
#
# Every other cell here takes `genView` from `ci/flake.nix`, which builds it with `import ../lib`
# from ci's own flake INPUTS, so the root shim is never evaluated and its `ci/flake.lock`-backed
# defaults are never forced. That is precisely where this library's non-flake contract lives:
# `import ./. { }` must produce the same library the flake path does, resolving both dependencies
# from `./ci/flake.lock` with no argument supplied and no search path consulted.
#
# ★★ THE CALL IS ARITY-DISPATCHED, NOT `import ../.. { }`. A dependency-free library publishes its
# root as a bare VALUE rather than a function, so the literal application is wrong at those roots by
# design; `if builtins.isFunction v then v { } else v` is the one form total over the roster, and it
# is the same construct the shim's own `dep` uses.
#
# ★★★ THREE CELLS, ONE ORACLE, AND THE FIRST TWO ARE HERMETIC. The obligation is per DEPENDENCY
# PATH, not per library: a cell that reds when ANY ONE dependency is unreachable measures a
# disjunction while reading like a conjunction.
#   1. `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` — every WIRED dependency resolves to a node of ITS OWN
#      repository. `expr` and `expected` are both `mapAttrs` over the shim's own formal-to-path map,
#      so the domain is whatever the root wires and never a hand-written list.
#   2. `…-is-the-libs-own-formals` — the DENOMINATOR, taken independently of that map, so an empty
#      map cannot read as a pass.
#   3. `…-forces-every-dependency` — the FORCING half, and the only non-hermetic cell in this file.
#
# ★★ AND FOUR CELLS BELOW THEM, CLOSING THREE INVARIANTS THE THREE ABOVE REST ON: the shim's `wire`
# default (with its control), the `follows` walk — declared ONCE, in `default.nix`, and READ here
# rather than transcribed, so the control over a hermetic fixture lock is the whole oracle for that
# rule — and channel 2 of the shim's three, the `inputs` override bag.
#
# ★★★ AND THREE ARMED PAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THE FILE, OVER THE SHIM'S TEXT AND ITS SIGNATURE — the
# two things no cell above can reach, because every one of them either closes the dependency channel
# or stops its force at WHNF.
#   · `…-no-dependency-is-built-past-its-own-entry` — a direct reach into a dependency's own `lib/`,
#     bypassing `dep`. A lazy, unforced one is a pure TEXT defect, which is exactly the class a
#     forcing cell cannot see.
#   · `…-the-entry-application-is-total` — the shim's DECLARED formal set against `entryArgs`. A
#     formal declared and never threaded into `deps` is in `functionArgs` and in no `paths` key, so
#     this is the one cell in the file that sees it.
#   · `…-the-entry-is-never-applied-to-a-literal` — the STRUCTURAL half, read off this file's own
#     text, so the property survives tomorrow's edit rather than describing today's.
# Each carries its own control, exercising the SAME operand at an input the main arm does not use.
#
# ★★ THE DOMAIN IS THE WIRED SET, NOT THE DECLARED SET — AND IT IS THE `deps` HALF OF THE RECORD
# THE SHIM'S BODY HANDS TO `wire`, NOT THE ATTRSET `./lib` RECEIVES. The two coincide only while
# `wire`'s own default is `{ deps, resolve }: import ./lib deps`, which is a property of ONE LINE OF
# TEXT and is held by `…-the-wire-default-is-the-librarys-own-application` below and by nothing
# else. `paths` reads the `deps` handed to `wire`, so a formal that is declared and never threaded
# into it is invisible to every cell over it. That is a domain statement rather than a gap — the
# shim's DECLARED formals are read by `…-the-entry-application-is-total` against `entryArgs`, which
# is where a stray formal surfaces. The DENOMINATOR cell is a different pair for a different reason:
# it compares the WIRED set against `../../lib`'s own formals and never sees one.
#
# ★★★ THE THIRD CELL IS NOT HERMETIC, AND THAT IS ITS WHOLE POINT. Forcing the defaults IS
# `builtins.fetchTree`, so it reaches the network — the accepted price of measuring the thing at
# all, and the reason it sits apart from the suites that must not. It remains PURE: `fetchTree` on a
# locked node is narHash-addressed, with no channel and no `<…>`.

  # ★★ THE SHIM'S DECLARED ARGUMENT SET, BOUND ONCE AND TOTAL BY CONSTRUCTION — the `expected` half
  # of `…-the-entry-application-is-total`, and the only thing in this file that names the shim's
  # DECLARED formals rather than its WIRED ones. The dependency members come from the SAME bindings
  # `ci/flake.nix` builds its `lib` output from, so this set is what an offline application of the
  # root would actually take; the seam members are closed the way that application would close them.
  #
  # ★ STATED CEILING, because it is the difference between this library and the siblings that carry
  # a standalone-application cell: nothing in this file APPLIES this set, so its VALUES are read by
  # no cell and only its key set is oracled. That is enough for the class it exists to catch — a
  # formal the shim declares and never threads into `deps` appears in `functionArgs` and not here,
  # and reds — and it is less than a sibling holding the same set through a live application.
  #
  # ★ THE `throw`s ARE NOT THE GUARD, they are what would make non-hermeticity IMPOSSIBLE rather
  # than merely detected for such an application: a shim carrying `...` would swallow these keys
  # unread and unreported. The guard is the cell pair below.

  # ★★ THE SEAM-CLOSING ARGUMENT SET, BOUND RATHER THAN WRITTEN AT THE APPLICATION. `dep` stops the

  # default is `{ deps, resolve }: import ./lib deps`, a text property the cell at the foot of this
  # file is what holds, and whose `resolve` half is the shim's own `follows` rule, which is why
  # nothing below transcribes that rule. So this application is hermetic by CONSTRUCTION and not by

  # ★★★ THE SHIM'S OWN RESOLVER, READ RATHER THAN RETRANSCRIBED. `default.nix` holds the ONE
  # declaration of the `follows` rule in this library and publishes it in the record its body hands
  # to `wire`; this is that binding and not a copy of it. So the fixture control below drives the
  # expression the shim itself resolves with, and `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` resolves the shim's
  # declared paths by the shim's own rule rather than by a second copy that can agree with its own
  # expectation while both are wrong.
  shimResolve = seam.resolve;

  # ★ THE ci LOCK, READ AS PURE DATA — and the rule that walks it is NOT TRANSCRIBED HERE:
  # `shimResolve` above IS `default.nix`'s binding. A direct edge IS the node key; a `follows` value
  # is a PATH resolved segment by segment from this lock's own root. Never `lock.nodes.<label>` — a
  # last-segment shortcut reads a DIFFERENT node in general, though at THIS library's own ci lock
  # `gen-prelude`'s node key happens to equal its label, so this one lock cannot discriminate the two
  # rules by itself — which is exactly why the fixture control below is the whole oracle for the
  # rule, not a supplement to it. Reading the lock is pure data; nothing here fetches.
  lock = builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ../../flake.lock);

  # ★★ THE RESOLVER IS BOUND OVER ITS LOCK, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES ITS CONTROL EXPRESSIBLE AT ALL. A
  # `repoOf` closed over THIS lock has no free parameter, so a control could only re-assert the main
  # arm's own value; taking the lock as an argument is what puts the control AT AN INPUT THE MAIN ARM
  # DOES NOT USE. `shimResolve` takes its lock the same way and for the same reason — which is why
  # `default.nix` publishes the LOCK-PARAMETERISED rule rather than its own applied `fetch`. The
  # `lock` formal here deliberately shadows the binding above.
  #
  # ★★★ AND THE CONTROL IS NOT CEREMONY, IT IS THE ENTIRE ORACLE FOR THIS RULE — which this library
  # declares EXACTLY ONCE, in `default.nix`, so *this rule* now names one expression and not two. A
  # cell reading `locked.repo` off a shortcut-indexed node can pass while the shortcut and the real
  # path walk land on different nodes, because `locked.repo` is frequently identical under both —
  # only a hermetic fixture built to disagree by construction can tell the two rules apart, and it is
  # what drives the SHIM's own binding below rather than a second copy of it.
  repoOf = lock: segs: lock.nodes.${shimResolve lock segs}.locked.repo;

  # both branches of `following` are exercised. Walking `[ "a" "b" ]` lands on `the-walked-node`;
  # indexing the last segment lands on the unrelated node keyed `b`. The two rules disagree BY
  # CONSTRUCTION, which is what makes the control total over every library rather than over the ones
  # whose own lock happens to disagree. It is a literal: nothing here reads a file or fetches.
