# THE STANDALONE ROOT ENTRY — the plain-import path, which no other cell in this suite reaches.
#
# ★★★ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ON DAY ONE. Every other suite here builds the library by importing
# `../lib` directly with injected values, so the ROOT `default.nix` — the entry a non-flake
# consumer actually uses — would be evaluated by nothing. A shim can therefore name fewer arguments
# than the library it delegates to, promise lockstep with the flake in its own comment, and stay
# green forever; the class has fired repeatedly across this ecosystem, always that way. It is built
# in here rather than added after the first failure.
#
# ★★ THE CELL IS PURE, AND THE PURITY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF HOW IT IS CALLED. The shim's defaults
# `builtins.fetchTree` the flake-locked revs; supplying BOTH formals explicitly means those
# defaults are never forced, so this reaches the network not at all. What it tests is the shim's
# SIGNATURE and its delegation — which is precisely where the defect lives.
#
# ★ IT CATCHES BOTH DIRECTIONS OF THE DRIFT, which is why it is an argument-passing cell rather
# than an `attrNames` comparison alone:
#   · a shim naming FEWER formals than `lib` refuses this application by name
#     (`called with unexpected argument 'graph'`);
#   · a shim that forwards fewer than `lib` requires refuses inside it
#     (`called without required argument 'graph'`).
# Both are uncatchable evaluator refusals, so either turns this cell ☢️ rather than ❌ — a crash is
# the loudest reading available and is the right one for an entry point that does not exist.

  # ★ THE FOUR CELLS ABOVE CANNOT SEE THIS CLASS, and the reason is the property that makes them
  # hermetic: they supply every dependency formal explicitly, so the shim's `fetch`-backed DEFAULTS —
  # which is where the divergence lives — are never forced. Forcing them would put `builtins.fetchTree`
  # inside the suite. This cell reads the CONSTRUCTION instead of the outcome, which is strictly wider:
  # it also catches the member that never throws (a defaulted formal on the far side turns the loud arm
  # of the class silent) and the member that has not yet drifted.
  #
  # ★★ COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY. `ci/tests/purity.nix`
  # states the same property for the same reason and over this same file (`stripComments (builtins.readFile
  # ../../default.nix)`): the house convention for a FIXED member is a comment explaining why not `/lib`,
  # and a raw scan reds on that comment while the file is correct. MEASURED, in-suite, on a tree whose
  # member had just been fixed — with a comment PLANTED in the house idiom, because no live site reds
  # today: every existing such comment happens to write `` `./lib` `` (relative, uninterpolated), and
  # raw ≡ stripped across all 14 domain files at HEAD. The strip is PROPHYLACTIC, and that is the
  # point — it stops the next correctly-written comment from reddening a correct file.
  #
  # ★ `[[:space:]]*` spans the newline a formatter may put between `/lib"` and `{` — measured: a
  # line-anchored form misses exactly that.
  #
  # ★★ THE NEEDLE IS BOUND ONCE AND BOTH CELLS READ THAT BINDING. Two literals spelled the same are
  # TWO PREDICATES, and the control would then guard only its own copy: MEASURED — with the needle
  # duplicated, breaking the MAIN copy by one character gave `2/2 successful, exit 0` over a tree
  # carrying a real member, with the control still ✅ in the same run. That is §1.5's class — a second
  # signature nothing compares against the first — committed by the instrument built to detect it.
  # With the shared binding the same one-character break REDS THE CONTROL.
  #
  # ★ A bare `.../lib` with NO argument set is EXCLUDED, and the exclusion is a claim about the FAR SIDE
  # AT ITS PIN rather than about this file: it holds only while the target's `lib` is a value. All
  # nineteen such sites in this domain reach gen-prelude / gen-identity / gen-algebra, each measured
  # `"set"` 2026-08-29. It is NOT a property of the spelling — `den-hoag-jhsb` measured
  # `select ? import "${fetch "gen-select"}/lib"` in gen-pipe yielding a LAMBDA (gen-select's `lib` takes
  # `{ algebra }`), a silent member this predicate does not count — and this cell cannot observe its own
  # premise going false. See §4.4.
