# THE STANDALONE ROOT ENTRY — the plain-import path, which no other cell in this suite reaches.
#
# ★★★ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ON DAY ONE. Every other suite here builds the library by importing
# `../lib` directly with injected values, so the ROOT `default.nix` — the entry a non-flake
# consumer actually uses — would be evaluated by nothing. A shim can therefore name fewer arguments
# than the library it delegates to, promise lockstep with the flake in its own comment, and stay
# green forever; the class has fired repeatedly across this ecosystem, always that way. It is built
# in here rather than added after the first failure.
#
# ★★ THE CELL IS PURE, AND THE PURITY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF HOW IT IS CALLED. The shim's defaults
# `builtins.fetchTree` the flake-locked revs; supplying BOTH formals explicitly means those
# defaults are never forced, so this reaches the network not at all. What it tests is the shim's
# SIGNATURE and its delegation — which is precisely where the defect lives.
#
# ★ IT CATCHES BOTH DIRECTIONS OF THE DRIFT, which is why it is an argument-passing cell rather
# than an `attrNames` comparison alone:
#   · a shim naming FEWER formals than `lib` refuses this application by name
#     (`called with unexpected argument 'graph'`);
#   · a shim that forwards fewer than `lib` requires refuses inside it
#     (`called without required argument 'graph'`).
# Both are uncatchable evaluator refusals, so either turns this cell ☢️ rather than ❌ — a crash is
# the loudest reading available and is the right one for an entry point that does not exist.
